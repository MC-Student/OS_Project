public class SlaveA {

 /*
 When a slave receives a job, it should “work” on it by sleeping.
 When the slave is finished, it alerts the master that the job is complete,

  There will be two different types of “jobs”, A and B.
   Slave-A is optimized to perform jobs of
   type A and Slave-B is optimized to perform jobs of type B,
    both slave types can do the job for which
   they aren’t optimized, it just takes them longer.
   You will simulate this by having a slave sleep for 2 seconds
   for its optimal job, and 10 seconds for its non-optimal job

   FOOD FOR THOUGHT:
   One slave program or two?

    //Receive jobs assigned to me
    //Determine if job is type A or B
    //Sleep type A for 2 seconds
    //Sleep type B for 10 seconds
    //Remove job when complete?
    //As soon as job finishes sleeping, send message to Master that job has completed
